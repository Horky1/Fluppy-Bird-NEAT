# Fluppy-Bird-NEAT
This repository contains an implementation of the Flappy Bird game that uses a neuroevolutionary algorithm (NEAT) to automatically train the birds that play the game. The player has the ability to interact with the game through the Tkinter GUI, where they can change game settings, run the game, and view results.

Main Features:

NEAT Algorithm: Uses a neuroevolutionary algorithm to automatically teach birds to play the game by avoiding pipes and collecting points.
Tkinter GUI: Implemented a graphical user interface for convenient control of game parameters and interaction with the player.
Game Settings: The player can adjust the number of units, the number of generations, the maximum score and other parameters through the GUI.
Saving and Opening Results: Ability to save changes to game parameters, as well as open files with training results.

Technologies used:

Python
Pygame
Tkinter
NEAT-Python

Instructions for Use:

Run the game through the Tkinter GUI.
Change the game settings if necessary.
Press the "Start" button to start training the birds.
Track game results and parameters through the GUI.
End the game and close the application.
